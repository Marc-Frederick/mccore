2006-06-29 19:12  thibaup

	* * Version 1.6.1
	  
	  
	  ** HomogeneousTransfo class reimplemented
	  
	  New implementation of HomogeneousTransfo class. Replaced the 16
	  float
	  array by 12 independent float variables for first three row of
	  the 4X4
	  matrix. Last row is implicit (always {0,0,0,1}). The interface is
	  unchanged.
	  
	  Using default gcc optimization (-O2), matrix multiplication is
	  now
	  100X faster and matrix inversion is near 200X faster.
	  Multiplication
	  by a 3D point (Vector3D) at same speed, however.
	  
	  New implementation of matrix inversion. Previous implementation
	  was
	  using the analytical simplification applicable to rigid body
	  transformation. However, this method shows unstable numerical
	  error. Therefore it was replaced by a general inversion method
	  applicable to any invertible matrix. This method isn't more
	  precise
	  than the latter method as a one-shot, but numerical errors are
	  stable. Even if more floating point operations are needed to do
	  so,
	  performance with default gcc optimization (-O2) is not
	  affected. Previous implementation was still conserved and renamed
	  invert_unstable().

	* using uname -s instead of uname -o for compatibility with Darwin

2005-05-31 20:05  thibaup

	* Modified I/O methods of primitive types to be compatible between
	  32b
	  and 64b architectures. Type sizes are written and read as follow:
	  
	  16b: char, unsigned char, signed char, short, unsigned short.
	  32b: int, unsigned, float.
	  64b: long int, unsigned long int, long long int, unsigned long
	  long int, double.
	  
	  Strings (char* or std::string) support is unchanged, i.e. the
	  length
	  integer precedes the character buffer. There is no support for
	  long
	  double or long long double.
	  
	  Switch between 32b and 64b was tested sucessfully in both
	  directions,
	  but endianess is still to be tested...

2005-05-31 19:55  thibaup

	* New utility class Version to output package version and building
	  information.

2005-04-27 16:44  thibaup

	* Copy constructor correction: atoms are copied from source object
	  using
	  the class interface in case the source object is an
	  ExtendedResidue
	  and needs to be placed (see class ExtendedResidue).

2005-04-13 16:04  thibaup

	  the
	  Pdbstream i/o for the PDB header records. For now the file header
	  is
	  kept in the Pdbstream, but it should be moved to the relevant
	  container, such as Molecule.

2005-02-10 18:41  thibaup

	  Removed unnecessary friendship from the iterator classes to the
	  wrapping Residue class.

2005-02-02 18:11  thibaup

	* Added new Atom method set(Vector3D) and set(Vector3D,AtomType*)

	* Molecule now uses its ModelFactoryMethod to manage all model
	  insertion, either from insert() or from an input stream reading.
	  The factory method is saved along with the object in binary
	  stream
	  I/O, thus a saved Molecule containing GraphModel will be restored
	  to a
	  Molecule with GraphModel.
	  The ResidueFactoryMethod is still not saved because an
	  ExtendedResidue
	  is fully restorable as a basic Residue, as the reverse. However
	  maybe
	  we should save it and restore it as the ModelFactoryMethod for
	  better
	  consistency in the design...

2005-01-26 19:17  larosem

	* ostream operator<< moved to std namespace.

2005-01-26 15:39  thibaup

	  stacking
	  types.

2004-12-03 16:21  sebastienl

	* Corrected a compilation warning in AtomTypeStore.cc.

2004-12-03 16:08  sebastienl

	* Changed the getVDWR, getAmberEpsilon and getAmberCharge methods
	  to require
	  a ResidueType instead of a Residue. This creates a new problem:
	  the type
	  is not sufficient to distinguish terminal residues. Parameters
	  currently
	  assumes that no residue is terminal.

2004-10-15 20:35  thibaup

	* Implementation now uses STL string instead of C-style char*.
	  External view unchanged except:
	  1- toString() (and toLongString() for residue types) returns a
	  reference to a STL string.
	  operator const char* () can still be used.
	  2- static method AtomType::getColor() now moved within atom type
	  classes.

	  * Ribose building major implementation modification:
	  - 5' branch construction places also O1P and O2P along.
	  - Removed static method createPhosphate5p().
	  - Removed all buildRiboseByCCM4D methods and renamed
	  buildRiboseByCCM2D() to buildRiboseByCCM().
	  - Added the possibility to pass a referential to override the
